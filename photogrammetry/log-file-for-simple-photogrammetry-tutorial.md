# what I was trying to do

build a 3D model using photogrammetry.

+ tutorial: https://graddh.netlify.app/docs/tutorials/photogrammetry/
+ repo: `[photogrammetry](https://github.com/bad-d0nkey/digital_tune_up/photogrammetry)`

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

3d models and ar experiences are something i want to do as a "next step" after building archives. start with collecting stories and studying words -> end with making those histories relatable through experience

## what I did

+ step 1: read
  + the 5706 tutorial
  + the ODATE tutorial
  + the regard3d (Heidstand) tutorial

+ step 2: built the Sceaux Castle 
  + i mean, not really - this was pretty bad - but i built a few models and ended up with this one being the clearest
  + i tinkered with various settings, but this was taking so long in each go that i didn't bother rendering too many models
    + in future, i will find a machine that has more power so i can render to my heart's content    

+ step 3: tried to build part of the el mirador
  + tinkered with this a few different ways -> no matter what i tried, it ended up coming out creepy and dali-esque
  + for this model, i used the following:
    + computing matches -> slid sliders all the way to the right, used TBMR
    + triangulation -> 
    + surface -> set to
