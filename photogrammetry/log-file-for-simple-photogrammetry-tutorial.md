# what I was trying to do

build a photogrammetry model from some pics i had and had been trying to get into a model for a while. also, maybe start with actually having something photogrammetry-y actually work. maybe by _not_ starting with something complicated like my pics. ;) something about... crawling? was it? before walking? i believe? or something like that.

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

3d models and ar experiences are something i want to do as a "next step" after building archives. start with collecting stories and studying words -> end with making those histories relatable through experience

## what I did

+ step 1: read
  + the 5706 tutorial
  + the ODATE tutorial
  + the regard3d (Heidstand) tutorial

+ step 2: built the Sceaux Castle 
  + i mean, not really - this was pretty bad - but i built a few models and ended up with this one being the clearest  

+ step 3: (tried) to build the el mirador
  + computing matches -> set to , TMBR
  + triangulation -> 
  + surface -> set to
