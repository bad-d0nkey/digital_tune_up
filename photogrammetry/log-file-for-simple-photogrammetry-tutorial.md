# what I was trying to do

build a 3D model using photogrammetry.

+ tutorial: https://graddh.netlify.app/docs/tutorials/photogrammetry/
+ repo: `[photogrammetry](https://github.com/bad-d0nkey/digital_tune_up/photogrammetry)`

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

3d models and ar experiences are something i want to do as a "next step" after building archives. start with collecting stories and studying words -> end with making those histories relatable through experience

## what I did

+ step 1: read
  + the 5706 tutorial
  + the ODATE tutorial
  + the regard3d (Heidstand) tutorial

+ step 2: built the Sceaux Castle 
  + i mean, not really - [this was pretty bad](https://github.com/bad-d0nkey/digital_tune_up/blob/84cd2154b95b8abc247bdf49d7eb31e9f954c772/photogrammetry/sceaux_castle.r3d) - but i built a few models and ended up with this one being the clearest
  + i tinkered with various settings, but this was taking so long in each go that i didn't bother rendering too many models
    + in future, i will find a machine that has more power so i can render to my heart's content    

+ step 3: tried to build part of the el mirador
  + tinkered with this a few different ways -> no matter what i tried, it ended up coming out creepy and dali-esque
  + i used the advised presets in the tutorial 
    + this had started out more detailed, with records for 3 different versions of settings i used, but something went awry with my log file and i lost the deets -> sigh 
       
## challenges 

i need to work through things methodically so i can identify cause/effect - not being able to do this on my tablet (which is fairly powerful, particuarly for a tablet, but let's not pretend it's a rocket ship...) hindered my being able to play with settings and just render, render, render to see the results. i try to keep my laptop unencumbered so i can do the masses of text analysis i do. i think if want to do the things i want to do in future (like modelling), i am going to need to resurrect my "desktop 2" setup with a tower dedicted to machinations.

i had a hard time getting regard3d to work with some pics i had, though they were taken on the same camera and had all the metadata entered. i could not identify what the problem was. according to the intertubes, there was nothing wrong with the dataset. meh. i moved on and got something else to work.

## thoughts on where to go next

first things first, work through different permutations so i can figure out what does what, how, and why. 

at some point, waaaaay in the tomorrows, when i've sorted myself here, i'll start looking at perhaps giving the meshroom setup a go.
