# what I was trying to do

gave the storymap.js tutorial a whirl
+ tutorial: https://graddh.netlify.app/docs/tutorials/storymaps/
+ repo: `[storymap](https://github.com/bad-d0nkey/digital_tune_up/storymap)` 

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

i keep meaning to start learning storytelling/mapping methods, but never carve out the time. it's the complement to the text analysis/archive work i want to do. no time like the present.

## what I did

+ step 1: got prepped
	+ set up storymap account
	+ set up parameters for the map
	+ found my way around
	
+ step 2: completely dorked out on edith piaf
  + i decided to do something fun and having heard a song from you youth recently, edith piaf had been on my mind. went for it.
    + couldn't help but note that it's crazy we're "surprised" by the amount of misinformation about serious things like COVID when people are happy to recycle bunk "facts" about something as simple as a well-documented biography. donkey pause. donkey reflect. donkey has been spending too much time coding q tweets.

  + rounded out my knowins about la belle chanteuse and sketched out a script, keeping the storytelling tips in mind
  + collected photos to complement the story, recorded their sources 

+ step 3: made the map
	+ this was wonderfully easy - i love that i could just use the link to the pictures instead of downloaded files
	+ the story was chill to construct,too

+ step 4: collected url, adios
  + snagged me [a link](https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/3d112332d6f8d1cf814fc6d585480cb8/la-vie-de-edith-piaf/index.html) and that was that

## challenges 

i had an issue with picture sizing. i ended up doing it the dirty way with the snipping tool for a couple. i need to actually make a point of learning how to resize pictures and how to know what sizes are needed for different purposes in general. i knew these things ages ago and then i got an assistant. details slip and... here we are. bad donkey.

the map itself isn't that interesting. i was mindful of the two tips in the tutorial about high locomotion in the story and a building narrative. i did all right, but if i were to use this for something, i would be mindful of the _kind_ of structure that really makes it pop. better next time!

**addendum** apparently figuring out how to embed the map in a text file is also a challenge. i am discording on it.

## thoughts on where to go next

toss-up between figuring out the details i mentioned in challenges (esp. re: picture sizing) and taking another shaky step out into mapping. i had tried some before but it was very difficult (the entry-level seminar was for some tech that required serious chops! lol.). this has been quite encouraging.
