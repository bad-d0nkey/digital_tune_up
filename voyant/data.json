Governor\nPatterson today vetoed the bill pro\nhibiting the manufacture of intoxicat\ning liquors after January 1, 1910. The\ngovernor's reasons for the vote are\nas follows: \"It's ruthlessness de\nprives the state of revenue without\nany sort of corresponding benefit. It\ndiscriminates against our own people\nin favor of the people of other states.\nIt destroys property of citizens, with\nout compensation. It makes a dan\ngerous precedent, humiliates Tennes\nsee and lowers the place of dignity\nsuch as it has occupied as one of the\nproudest and most onservative states\nin the Union. It violates the will of\nthe people twice expressed by the bal\nlot box, offends against their sense of\njustice, and under a plea of civic\nrighteousness, sacrifices the great\nmoral principle of government at the\nvery altar where it should be guarded\nand defended.\" The governor says\nthat if this legislature shall destroy\nall distilleries and breweries why can\nnot the next forbid the raising or sell\ning of grains or the cultivation of the\ngrape out of which liquors are made.\nIt is better not to start, for there is\nno end. It is a foregone conclusion\nthat the bill will be passed over his\nveto.\n.Later The bill has been passed by\nthe senate over the governor's veto\nby a vote of 20 to 12.\nDIE IN EACH\nkOIHER'5 ARMS\nCouple Registering Under False\nNames Are Asphyxiated.\n\"DViIlalaliiMn Pa T,vlna flprnas thp\nbed, fully dressed ana wun tneir arms\nabout each other, a man believed to\nbe Maurice P.

Hewett,\ndirector of the American work of the\nArchaeological Institute of America.\nThat so large a number of people\nshould seek admittance to the lecture\nroom was indeed a most gratifying\nsign and fully indicated the profound\ninterest that has been aroused by the\nproposed establishment of an Ameri\ncan School of Archaeology at Santa\nFe. Among those present were Gov\nernor Curry, Chief Justice V. J. Mills\nand other officials, and the members of\nthe legislature before whom will come\nup for passage, a bill that will make\nthe proposed school a reality.\nIntroductory Remarks By Judge\nMcFie.\nShortly after 8 o'clock when as\nmany people had been seated as was\npossible, Judge John R. McFie arose\nto make the opening remarks. The\njudge who Is the president of the New\nMexico Archaeological Society, began\nby explaining how ten years ago, at\ntention had been called to the fact\nthat parties of men were engaged in\ndespoiling the ruins of the cliff dwell\ners and were carrying away from the\nterritory very valuable specimens and\nrelics. These were carted away by\nthe carload and sold, being now scat\ntered in all parts of the Globe in vari\nous museums. This discovery, said\nthe judge, lead to the immediate found-\n\"Old Palace\" to Be Home\ning of the New Mexico Archaeological\nSociety, which society at once sent to\nCongress a set of resolutions, protest\ning against the spoliation of the fa\nmous ruins and canons. The govern\nment heeled the protest and sent men\nhere to put a stop to the matter. The\nNew Mexico School of Archaeology,\nsaid Judge McFie, is not merely a lo\ncal one, but is a terirtorial institu\ntion, intended for the benefit of all\npeople in the territory. .\nThree Schools In Europe.\nThe speaker then called attention\nto the fact that three years ago, Pro\nfessor Hewett had brought the fact to\nthe knowledge of the people of New\nMexico that Europe had three schools\nof archaeology, one at Rome, Italy,\noue at Athens, Greece, and one at\nJerusalem, Palestine, the two former\nbeing schools of classical and the lat\nter a school of Oriental archaeology,\nand that as the time had arrived to\nestablish a school in America, he sug\ngested that New Mexico at once make\nefforts, to secure the location for the\nschool in the territory, as this section\nwas the real archaeological center.\nThe establishment of the school at\nSanta Fe would - insure a steady\nstream of scientific and prominent\npeople coming from all parts of the\nworld. The judge then related the\ncircumstances that had in former\nyears brought Professor Hewett to\nNew Mexico and stated that the Pro\nfessor's love for the territory had\never become warmer and that the j\nprofessor always had its interest atj\nheart, He then Introduced the lec-,\n,\niiii-f if3&!!si--. -;tn- I\nL\nturer of the evening who was enthu\nsiastically greeted.\nLays Down the Facts.\nProfessor Edgar L. Hewett, who is\nthe best posted man on the subject of\nAmerican Archaeology, commenced\nhis lecture with the statement that\nhis mission was solely to lay before\nthe people of New Mexico certain\nfacts in the matter of securing a loca\ntion for the American ' School of\nArchaeology. He invited the audience\nto ask him such questions as they de\nsired either during the course of the\nlecture or afterwards. When the time\nhad arrived, he said, to look about\nfor a suitable location for the estab.\nlishment of the American School of\nArchaeology, Ihe entire country was\ngone over and the wonderful pre-hls-toric\nremains around aSnta Fe drew\nthe attention of the locating commit\nteen who soon decided that Santa Fe\noiild make ideal headquarters for the\nschool providing the proper conces\nsions could be obtained.\nExhibits Interesting Views.\nThe Professor stated that he did\nnot intend to lecture upon the subject\nof archaeology itself, but wanted to\nImpress upon the audience the import\nance of establishing the archaeolog\nical school at Santa Fe, to convince\nthem of the manifold advantages that\nwould accrue to Santa Fe and the en\ntire territory, and to make plain to\nall that the Archaeological Institute\nof America asked but very little\nu.ion the part of the people of New\nof Proposed State Museum and School\nMexico preparatory to the establish\nment of the school. In order to illus\ntrate the wonderful field of research\noffered in New Mexico and to show\nwhat great amount of work had al\nready been accomplished, the leturer\nhad tlyown upon a screen, numerous\nexceedingly interesting pictures.\nCliff Dwellers and Pueblos.\nAmong the pictures were views of the\nancient ruins of the cliff dwellers and\npueblos. The reotoration of many\nporches in front of the cliff dwellings\nwas shown and pictures of the re\ncesses iu the cliffs were also shown,\nwhich the professor explained were\nback rooms in the rear of pueblo\nstructures. The statement that such\nPueblo structures existed in front of\nthe cliff rooms, in tiers from one to\nfour stories and that porches were\nbuilt in front of many of them, was\nnot mere conjecture, said Hewett, but\nbased on proved facts. Many pictures\nwere shown illustrating the work of\nrestoration that has and is still being\ncarried on, the idea in view, accord\ning to the lecturer, being to restore\nas much as possible of the old ruins\nback to their primitive exactness, so\nthat travelers and students can visit\nthe various places and see for them\nselves everything just as It was when\nthe ancient race of people were in ex\nistence and dwelling there. The aud\nience displayed deep interest in this\nplan of developing a great attracting\npower for New Mexico. The pictures\nshowing the work of excavating were\nhighly interesting and instructive and\nthist work would be well worthy of a\ndetailed description which lack of\nQGICAL\nspace forbids. As an example of the'\nmany signs of great age thai are con\nstantly iu evidence around the ruins\na picture was shown of a path that\nhad been used by the uncivil t people\ninhabiting those parts. Tlie path had\nbeen worn hip deep. The lecturer\nthen went on to explain how difficult\nit was to travel from Colorado to the\nruins In southern Colorado and north\nern New Mexico aiul stated that Santa\nFe was the nearest point and that as\nsoon as a railroad was put through\nfrom Santa Fe to the San Juan re\ngion, the advantages to Santa Fe as a\nstarting point would be mill greater\nand all of that country would then be\ntributary to it.\nSanta Fe the Logical Center.\nHe stated that Santa Fe is the ideal\nand logical center for scientltic re\nsearch along archaeological lines. No\nmatter to which direction you turn\nwhen in the capital city, said Profes\nsor Hewett. you are bound to face\nsections delightful')' replete with his\ntoric ruins and interesting subjects\nfor scientific and other studies, and\nall within a reasonable distance. To\nthe north, the east, the south and the\nwest are everywhere opportunities\nfor research, such as can be found no\nwhere else. Xew Mexico should in\ndeed, said he, not fail to grasp the\nopportunity now offered her.\nA Chartered Institution.\nProfessor Hewett explained that\nthe American Institute of Archaeol\nogy was not in any way under gov\nernment control, nor are its opera\ntions and researches under govern\nment supervision, but that it is an\ninstitution incorporated by act of\nthe United States Congress, its\nheadquarters necessarily being lo\ncated at Washington, D. C.\nThe Institution he said, can sup\nport schools over the entire world,\nunder the provisions of its charter.\nAll that the Institution required if it\nestablishes a school here at Santa Fe\nis the proper equipping of a suitable\n.building (in this case the Old Palace\nI building) so that a first-class museum\ncan he kept and so that the building\ncan he said to be absolutely safe and\nafford proper protection to the collec\ntions on exhibition therein, also that\nthe building be so arranged\nthat all specimens can be\npropeuly and advantageously dis\nplayed in cases provided for\nthe purpose. This latter require\nment can readily be appreciated when\nthe danger is known that is always\niminent from promiscuous handling\nof Ameri can Archaeology.\nof relics and from thefts to same.\nIn addition the Institution would prob\nably want to install collections show-\n! ing the work of its schools and re\nsearches in other parts of the world.\nAs these exhibitions would lie\nof iucalcuable value as an attractive\nekmtnt for Santa Fe and New Mexico,\nit can be seen that such a request is\nwire than reasonable. The next re\nquirement is that the territory ap\npropriate $5,000 a year for the main\ntenance of the museum (which will be\nalso the State Museum of New Mex\nico) for the payment of necessary\nemployes to look after the place. The\nInstitution will look after, the school\nend of the proposition by endowment,\nand this feature will be of no expense\nto the territory whatsoever.\nInsist on Having a Model Museum.\nHowever, said the Professor, the In\nstitution insists that If a school of\narchaeology is to be established at\nthis point, New Mexico must main\ntain a model museum, one that is\nthoroughly in keeping with the great\nness of the territory and the sur\nrounding country and worthy of the\nrespect and admiration of the entire\nworld. This, the lecturer said, New\nMexico can easily do. The estab\nlishing of the school here will be but\nthe beginning of a general endowment\nmovement, said he, which will be used\nto increase the greatness of the local\ninstitution. $\nAs a School of Research.\nProfessor Hewett stated that an\nable corps of scientific men would con-\n(Oontlnued On Page Eight.)\nEXEMPTID FOR\nIHE POOR\nEndorsed by Curry\nBefore County\nCommissioners\nIKES EXCELLENT SPEECH\nOutlines a Bill He is Having\nLrawn For Improvement\nof Public Highways.\nThe convention of the chairmen of\nthe various hoards of county commis\nsioners or the territory convened at\nthe court lHMi.se this morning at 10:30\no'clock. The committee apixiinted to\nmeet, Governor Curry to ascertain his\nwishes as to further proceedings of\nthe convention reported that the gov\nernor had consented to appear and\naddress the meeting. Governor Curry\nwas given a synopsis of what had\nbeen done by Secretary C. V. Saf\nford. The governor then said that he\nwas sure the convention would bear\nfruit as the commissioners had met\ntogether interchanging ideas and talk\ning over matters. He expressed a be\nlief that something definite should bo\ndone to secure more quitable assess\nments as he had previously said at\nthe opening of the convention.\nMr. Atkinson thought that there\nshould be a commission of three mem\nbers created which should spend two\nweeks in each county to secure a more\nequitable comparison of assessments.\nGovernor Curry Speaks.\nGovernor Curry then spoke at\nlength saying that Mr. Atkinson's sug\ngestions were along the line of those\npracticed in some states to bring\nabout more equitable assessments.\nHe said ho was heartily in favor of\nretaining the $200 exemption for the\nsake of the poor people and that such\nexemptions did not injure the terri\ntory near so much as the owners of\nlarge tracts of land who return same\nat 50 cents per acre.\nContinuing, he said: I\n\"It is your duty to go on record before-your\nconstituents to make such\nrecommendations as you think best\nfor the territory. Under our republi\ncan form of government 'every tub\nmust stand on its own bottom.' You\nhave legal obligations and you are to\nwork for the interests of the many,\nnot for the few large property hold\ners. Every state is having troubles\nin assessment and taxation and in a\nnew country like ours the matter is\nmore difficult.\n\"When I came here there was no\nrailroads, pave a few miles of the\nSanta Fe. No country in the world\nhad less lawlessness and crime. The\npeople were poor and lived econom\nically. With the advent of railroads\nand settlers new ideas were incul\ncated and some rather expensive.\nConsequently our taxes have gone up.\nI claim our assessment has not in\ncreased correspondingly with the ex\npenses of the government. No state\npays more for education in proportion\nto Its wealth than we, and still our\nschools are in session but a few\nmonths of the year. We need to Im\nprove conditions, have the schools Jn\nsession longer terms, better teachers\nand better communication between\ntowns and cities. i\n\"Ours is largely a cattle and sheep\ncountry, but it is fast becoming an\nagricultural country. In\" order to\nopen up the timber,, coal and mineral\nlnads we must do something for the\nhighways. These are two important\nmatters, schools and highways.\"\nProposed Road Bill.\nThe governor then outlined a bill he\nis having drawn for public highway\nimprovement. The bill provides for a\ncommission to be composed of the\ngovernor, the land commissioner and\nthe terirtorial enginer who shall have\nsupervision over the roads which they\nbuild and to co-operate with the\nboards of county commissioners.\nSpeaking of roads, Governor Curry\ncited the great need for improved\nroads between various points of the\nterritory as from Roswell to Carri\nzozo, from Las Vegas to the Mora val\nley and such. He believed that the\nconvicts should be employed upon\nthese roads which will be a perma\nnent and lasting benefit to the terri\ntory. The scenic highway was men\ntioned as an example of what could\nbe and should be accomplished in\nother places. f\nScenic Highway.\nMr. Burch of Raton then spoke of;\nthe scenic highway stating that the\nconvicts were now working about five\nmiles from Raton. They are now\nworking with the county grader and\nteams which f greatly facilitates the\nwork over the previous method ; of\nhand labor. The road is being fenced,\nbut at frequent intervals places are\nleft which are particularly adapted to\ncamping grounds, so that in reality it\nwill be a scenic highway.

Woman's\nclubs have prepared the way for\narchaeology. The cause of archaeol\nogy had to be presented at the bar of\nthe last resort, the woman's clubs and\nthe being found full of the humanities\nwas accepted by them.\nArchaeology said Dr. Carroll, is com\nposed of two words meaning the story\nof old things. That is archaeology is\nthe study of human progress as told\nby the monuments or materials found\nthat give us the history of the pro\ngress of the human race before the\nage of written history. Every one is\ninterested in the history of the hu\nman race and all realize the value of\nthe study of geology; how much more\nimportant then must the stndv of the\nprogress of the human soul be.\"\nDr. Carroll then compared the sev\nen ages of the world with Shake\nspeares seven ages of man. First the\nold stone age making the necessitities\nof stone with which to work. Next\nseeing the beautiful and polishing the\nsame necessary implements and dec\norating the caves with crude pictures.\nThen the wonderful bronze age of\n3,000 years of beautiful bronze work.\nNext the iron age of war with Its\npower. Then we come to the lovely\ngolden age of Greece when Athens\nwith her magnificent culture led the\nworld. A period of the dark age fol\nlowed by the silver age of the renais\nsance and our own wonder working\nn. ...I.... 1... n..TI...l .1\niy'i iuu ui utii may utr cunt'U Llie ae\nor electricity compiere tne seven and\nyet we are looking Into the future.\nMen say they have their faces to\nward that future and care not for\nthat past. Such men are as if they\nawakened to find that they had for\ngotten their own past. We are a race\nof modern men grafted on the civili\nzation of the long ago. Here is where\nthe woman's clubs interest in the\npast will be of importance. Not. long\nago we had only the written and fa\nbled history of the culture of Greece\nto 700 B. C. With the aid of archae\nology we now go to 3,000. Archaeolo\ngy and history linked together give\nus the complete story. Take 'he story\nof religion, Archaeology ilumlnes the\nstories of the old testament. Who\nhas not read the bible more under\nstanding after becoming acquainted\nwith the story of the prehistoric Ca\nnanltes. When the meeting in Wash\nington, D. C, concerning city beauti\nfying was in progress all the technical\npapers read seemed detached until\nthe one on archaeological city plan\nning connected all the branches of\nart and mechanical endeavor. Socio\nlogically we are not individuals so we\nmust plan for social salvation as well\nas individual salvation for social sal\nvation means individual salvation. The\nold Greeks and Romans had the civic\nspirit and believed in the community.\n\"There are lessons for all in the de\nvelopment of old Athens and Rome.\nThis (20th century) is essentially a\nwoman's age if all the ages have not\nbeen woman's. From the Garden of\nEden we have had the woman ques\ntion. The women of ancient Crete\nwere a power. Athens did not form\nas high a standard in this as she\ncould have done, but even there many\nwomen became famous unto our own\nday.

(Spe\ncial Correspondence.) Mr. D. I.\nBushnell, Jr., of the Peabody\nmuseum at Harvard has com\npleted a plaster model of the so-\ncalled Cahokla group of mounds In Illinois,\nthe preservation of which, either by pri\nvate purchase or a public appropriation, is\nbeing earnestly advocated by a number of\nAmerican archaeologists as a national duty\nin order that one of the most important\nof all the relics of the mysterious Mound\nBuilders may be saved for future study\nand investigation.\nThis remarkable ,group of mounds\nwould deprive America of what is, In many\nrespects, absolutely its most remarkable\nnative monument, and the archao3loglts\nare not alone In hoping; that it will be\navoided. Situated near the center of a\ngroup of some peventy-flve mounds prac\ntically also In the very centre of the Moun 1\nBuilder's empire, the great American bot\ntom land between the Mississippi and the\ncrescent shaped range of blurts that ba\ngins Just opposite the mouth of the Mis\nsouri. Cahokla affords a view of the valley in\nall directions, overlooking St. Louis, some\nthing over five miles to the west. Its sea-\naccount of his impressions Is still recog\nnizable by anyone who travels over the\nsame path, stated definitely that the monks\nlived near tho mound, but not on it. \"When\nI-reached the foot of the principal mound,\"\nwrote Mr. Breckenrldge, . \"I was struck'\nwith a degree of astonishment, not unlike\nthat which Is experienced In contemplating\nthe Egyptian pyramids. What a stupend\nous pile of earth! To heap up such a mans\nmust have required years, and the labors\nof thousands. It stands Immediately\non. the bank of the Cahokla, and on the\nside next to It, is covered with lofty trees.\n.Were it sot for tho regularity and design\n...... . . . v : ' ' ' ' ' '\"A-\ni\n'V J\n, . ..- - - - - \" \" ii i ir - ' t\nbT. louis was Built on\" a mound like this.\nA Unique Member of the Cahokla Group, West of the Great Mound and Unlike Any of the Others. It is One of the Few That\nHave Never Been Cultivated and Archaeologists Think It Almost an Exact Counterpart of the Large Mound Once Standing\nOn the Site of Modern St. Louis.\namong which the big Cahokla mound la\nfamous as the largest structure of its kind\nIn the world follows the winding course\nof the Little Cahokla river, near where It\nempties into the Mississippi, and was once\nconnected, by a line of single tumuli, with\nthe smaller group of mounds from which\nSt. Louis derives its title ' of the 'Mound\nCity.\" The great mound of St Louis has\nnow vanished forever, but one mound still\nremains among the Cahokla group which\nIs believed to be almost Its exact counter\npart. The age of these mounds antedates\nany tradition \"concerning them among the\nNorth American Indians. Like others\nscattered about in different parts of the\nUnited 8tates, they have figured promi\nnently in various romantic theories of an\nearly race, differing from the Indians,\nand was Anally either exterminated by\nthem or driven Into Central America,\nthere to become the precursors of the\ncivllUatlon discovered and destroyed by\nthe Spaniards. Modern archaeology, un\nfortunately for the romance of the story,\ndiscredits this picturesque theory and at\ntributes the mounds directly to the dis\ntant ancestors of the present Indians an\nexplanation that still leaves sufficient\nmaterial, however, for the Imagination.\nHowever that may be, Cahokla Is the\nking of all American mounds. It covers\nnearly fourteen acred of land, and stands,\nas has been said by Professor Putnam of\nHarvard, In the same relation to other\nmounds as the \"Great Pyramid of E$ypt\nto the monuments of the valley of the\nNile.\" It Is perhaps all the more interr\ning in that no measures have yet been\ntaken for its permanent preservation and\nIt Is therefore always In danger of being\nput to modern utilitarian purposes and so\nbecoming eventually a mere memory, hard\nly lesa dim than that of the mysterious na\ntion which originally built it Such a fate\neral structure suggests comparison with\nthe Teocalll, or ruined temples, of Mexico,\nand its more careful investigation, al\nthough neither money nor opportunity has\nyet made such investigation possible, is\nconsidered likely to be of the greatest\nvalue in the growing study of ' American\narchaeology. -'.\nIn its own immediate neighborhood Ca\nhokla is best known as \"Monk's mound,\"\na name derived from a mistaken tradition\nthat the old Trapplst monks once made it\ntheir headquarters. As long ago as 1811,\nhowever, Mr. 1L H. Breckenridge, whose\nwhich is manifest, the circumstance of its\nbeing on alluvial ground and the other\nmounds, scattered, around it, we could\nhardly believe it the work of human hands.\nThe shape Is that of a parallelogram,\nstanding from north to south; on the south\nside there is a broad apron or step, about\nhalf way down, and from this another\nprojection into the plain about fifteen feet\nwide, which was probably Intended as an\nascent, to the mound. . By stepping around\nthe . base I computed the circumference to\nbe at least 800 yards and the height of the\nmound about ninety feet The step or apron\nhas been used as a kitchen garden by the\nmonks of La Trappe settled nenr this, and\nthe top Is sowed with wheat.\" This early\nvisitor concluded, after an examination of\ntho other smaller mounds, \"that a very\npopulous town had once existed here, sim\nilar to those of Mexico described by the\nfirst conquerors. The mounds were sites\nof temples, or monuments to great men.\"\nAnother later writer, referring to Cahokla,\nhas suld: \"It is probable that upon this\nplatform was reared a capacious temple,\nwithin whose walls the high priests, gath\nered from different quarters at stated sea\nsons, celebrated their mystic rites, whilst\ntho swarming multitudes below looked up\nin mute adoration.\" Modern archaeology\ndiscredits the \"chphcIous temple,\" although\nit accepts the probability of swarming mul\ntitudes and the likelihood that one of the\nlargest humun-mndo piles of earth in the\nworld had a religious purpose. Mr. Bush\nnell is of this opinion, basing his belief upon\nthe fact that the largest structures raised\nby humanity have almost invariably proved\nto have a rellRlous significance.\nThe ago and actual purpose of the\nCahokla mound are questions which will\nperhaps never bo definitely answered, al\nthough, for all that is known at present\nthe answer may be patiently awaiting the\nmoment when the mound is carefully tun\nnelled and its contents investigated. Like\nthat of other relics of the Mound Builders,\nits uge was once thought to be undoubt\nedly several thousand years. According\nto this belief it might have antedated the\nruins that have been discovered In Central\nAmerica and a theory, has even been put\nforward that would carry it back to the\nmythical days of Atlantis, when a great\nconvulsion of nature was supposed to have\ndestroyed communication between the\neastern and western continents, before that\ntime united in a single body of land.\nModern archaeology has very much re\nduced, without absolutely disproving, the\nlikelihood of this remote antiquity, and the\nevidence so far gathered from the almost\ncountless ruins that dot the valley of the\nMississippi and its tributaries disproves\nalso the earlier belief that the race which\nmade them must have been materially dif\nferent from tho Indian tribes, who after\nward Inherited them. Tho absence of In\ndian tradition concerning the Mound Build\ners is, for example, no longer taken as\nproof of anything more than a comparative\n- antiquity, for a study of the Indian has\nshown that a few hundred years would\nhave sufficed as readily as a few thou-\n(Contlnued en Page Fifteen.)\n. \" : ' \" ' ' \"- . .

Taos County ,N JH\nJudge John R. McFie, president of\nthe New Mexico Archaeological So\nciety, Is in receipt of a letter from\nMiss Alice C. Fletcher of Washlng\nton7\"BTc., of the Archaeological In\nstitute of America, in which she ex\npresses her gratification at the work\nalready accomplished preliminary to\nthe actual installation or tne Terri\ntorial Museum in the Old Palace and\nthe opening of the School of Ameri\ncan Archaeology in the same Duuaing.\nShe calls especial attention to the\nadoption of the plan to carry on in\ntha Bin ttrande valley, the archaeo-\nlnerinn.1. ethnological and historical.\nwork together, and the benefit it\nwill prove to the New Mexico Muse\num. Herewith follows the text of a\ncircular issued by Director Edgar L.\nHewett, who expects to return here\nearly In June to take up the work\nactively:\nOrganization.\nThe Council of the Institute at Its\nannual meeting in Chicago, Decem\nber 31, 1907, established the School\nof American Archaeology. The act\nwhich created the school, as amended\nat the Toronto meeting in 1908, is as\nfollows:\nI. The School of American Archae\nology Is established to conduct the\nresearches of the Institute in trie\nAmerican field, and to afford oppor\ntunities for field work and training\nto students of Archaeology.\nII. The school will direct the ex\npeditions of the local . societies in\ntheir respective fields, maintain ar\nchaeolotrical researches in the vari\nous culture-areas of the American\ncontinent, direct the work of fellows\nand collaborate with Universities\nand other scientific organizations,\nboth home and foreign, in the ad\nvancement of archaeological research.\nIII. The committee heretofore\nknown as the Committee on Ameri\ncan Archaeology,\" ' with additional\nmembers as hereinafter provided for,\nshall become the managing commit\ntee of the school. The committee\nshall consist of twenty-eight elective\nmembers and the following ex-offlcio\nmembers: The president, secretary,\nand treasurer of the Institute, the\nchairmen of the managing commit\ntees of the American Schools in Ath\nens, Rome and Palestine, and the\nchairman of the committee on Media\neval and Renaissance Studies. The\ncommittee shall have power with the\nratification of the Council to elect\nIts own members and fill all vacan\ncies in Its membership. The term of\noffice shall be four years, and the\nterms of not more than seven mem\nbers shall expire in any one year.\nThere shall be an executive commit\ntee consisting of the chairman, sec\nretary and treasurer of the manag\ning committee, the president of the\nInstitute, and five elective members.\nThe committee shall appoint the\ndirector of American Archaeology\nwho shall be its executive officer and\ndirector of the school. The commit\ntee is authorized to maintain fellow\nships, archaeological stations, publi\ncations, and the . various lines of\nwork herein provided for, and to\nraise funds for the support of the\nsame. .Its funds shall be held by\nthe treasurer of the Institute, and\ndisbursed by him on the order of the\nchairman of the managing committee\napproved by the president of the In\nstitute. The Establishment at Santa Fe. (\nAt a meeting of the managing com\nmittee, held at Cambridge, Massa\nchusetts, October 14, 1908, it waB\nunanimously voted that the invitation\nof the New Mexico Archaeological\nSociety to establish the School of\nAmerican Archaeology in Santa Fe\nbe accepted, provided the plan for\nthe establishment, thereupon adopt\ned, should be confirmed by the Coun\ncil of the Institute and accepted by\nthe Legislative Assembly of New\nMexico. The Council at Its meeting\nin Toronto, Canada, unanimously ac\ncepted the plans adopted by the man\naging committee, and authorized the\nnecessary arrangements with the\ncommonwealth of New Mexico. Fol\nlowing this a bill, based upon the act\nof the Council of the Institute, was\npassed by the Legislative Assembly!\nof New Mexico, by virtue of which I\nthe commonwealth of New Mexico\nand the Archaeological Institute of\nAmerica joined in the establishment\nof . the school and museum at Santa\n1\na\ni' . i\nXX7I11 tr!4nM a Ilt.JJ.. m... d.:.li. nt.....\ntiycnd th reach of medicine. No medicine can do more. or DiabctM\nFe. The action taken is briefly as\nfollows:\nThe Museum of New Mexico Is\ncreated with an annual appropriation\nof $5,000 for maintenance and re\nsearch, and placed under the govern\nment of a board of regents, consist\ning of six members, three for the\ncommonwealth of New Mexico and\nthree for the governing body of the\nSchool of American Archaeology. The\nhistoric building known as the \"Gov\nernor's Palace,\" in Santa Fe, Is\ngranted for the use of the School\nand Museum which the Institute\nbinds itself to conduct. There is\nthus created a dual establishment,\nthe School, having Its own governing\nbody, and the Museum with its gov\nerning body, and the entire establish\nment is made a unit by virtue of\nhaving a single executive officer, the\nInstitute's director of American\nArchaeology.\nThe building granted for the home\nof the School and Museum is one of\nour noblest historic monuments. It\nIs well on in the third century of Its\nexistence and has been used as the\nresidence of the Governors and seat\nof authority under the three nations\nthat have successively dominated the\nSouthwest Spain, Mexico, and the\nUnited States. The building is a\none-story structure, with massive\nadobe walls from two to six feet\nthick, constructed In the characteris\ntic new world Spanish style of the\nseventeenth century, with a frontage\nof an entire block facing the central\nplaza of the Capital City of New\nMexico, and inclosing a large Interior\npatio. A special appropriation of\n$3,000 by the Territory is being used\nfor necessary improvements, and\nother funds are available for repairs\nand alterations. With some small\nrestoration the building will stand a\ntype of early Spanish-American archi\ntecture and will be preserved, as ex\npressly provided by both the act of\nthe Council of the Institute and that\nof the Legislative Assembly of New\nMexico, as a monument to the Span\nish founders of the' civilization of the\nSouthwest. At the same time, situ\nated as it is in relation to the richest\narchaeological fields in the United\nStates, it will afford an ideal home\nfor the School of American Archaeo\nlogy.\nOrganization of the Museum.\nThe board of. regents, constituted\nunder the provisions of the organic\nact, Is composed of the following\nmembers:\nHon. George Curry, Governor of\nNew Mexico; Hon. Nathan Jaffa, Sec\nretary of State of New Mexico; Jus\ntice John R. McFie, Hon. R. W. Cor-\nwin, Hon. Frank Springer, Hon\nCharles F. Lummis.\nAt the first meeting of the board\nheld in Santa Fe, April 5th, the board\nwas organized with Mr. Justice Mc\nFie as president, and Hon. Nathan\nJaffa, secretary and treasurer. The\ncustodianship of the Palace property\nwas formally accepted, the type of\nmuseum to be established considered\nat length, the expenditures for the\nyear 1909, for improvements, repairs\nand alteration of building and for\nresearch work authorized. The fol\nlowing museum assistants were ap\npointed: Mr. Kenneth M. Chapman,\nMr. Sylvanus G. Morley, and Mr.\nJesse L. Nusbaum.\nField Work for the Year 1909.\nI. In Utah The explorations and\nexcavations that have been in prog\nress In southern Utah for two years\npast will be continued. The expedi\ntion for 1909 will be in collaboration\nwith the State University of Utah,\nand will start about June 1st. The\nexpedition's base will be at Wether-\nill's trading post on the Moonlight,\nsouth of the San Juan river, about\nfour miles north of the Arizona-Utah\nline, and the excavations will be in\nthe pueblo and cliff-house ruins - in\nthe vicinity of Navajo mountain. As\nmany students as can be accommo\ndated in this expedition have already\nbeen admitted.\nII. In Colorado For the benefit of\nthe teachers in attendance at the\nmeeting of the National Education\nAssociation in Denver, July 5-10, the\nColorado Society of the Institute has\narranged for an archaeological ex\ncursion to the cliff dwellings of Mesa\nVerde National Park, with lectures\nat the ruins on the excavations that\nwill be in progress at Cliff Palace un\nder the auspices of the Smithsonian\nInstitution. The lectures will be\ngiven by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, direc\ntor, of the excavations, and will be\ngin Monday, July 12th. The lectures\nwill be free to the public. Arrange\nments can be made at Mancos, Colo\nrado, for transportation to and camp\ning privileges at the ruins. Special\nannouncements will be issued at Den\nver during the N. E. A. meeting.\nThose desiring further information\nin advance should correspond with\nMrs.. Lucy E. Peabody, 1430 Corona\nStreet, Denver, Colorado.\n- III. In New Mexico The excava\ntions begun by the School last year\nin the Rlto de los Frijoles, thirty\nmiles northwest of Santa Fe, will be\ncontinued. The work will begin July\n12th, and continue until September\n1st ... This will be the principal field\nwork of the year that will be open to\nstudents.\nA considerable number can be ad\nmitted to this expedition. General\nrules concerning eligibility are not\nlaid down. Every applicant will be\nconsidered individually. Women\nstudents can be accommodated in\nthe New Mexico expedition, where\nthe site chosen for excavation is\nagreeably situated in the Pajarito\nPark, and a field matron will be\npresent...-;\nAll students will pay their own\ntraveling expenses to and from the\nfield and provide their own personal\nI \" II\nI v, m\nn w\nII V- ''\"v.- iA\nII ,-'-T-\nII D w.-Svfcs-i\nII I i'' 3 Si i\nV -\"\"\nNew Mexico Military Institute\nROSWELL, NEW MEXICO.\nThs West Point of the Southwest\"\nArmy Officers Detailed by War Department.\nArmy Inspectors BANK SCHOOL IN CLASS\n\"A.\"\nThrough Academic course, preparing young\nmen (or college or for business life.

Initial steps have\nalso been taken to extend the Depart\nment of Canada into Quebec, Hamil\nton and Vancouver. The Canadian\nCouncil of the Institute which super\nvises the affairs of the department,\nembraces such well known names as\nSir Charles Fitzpatrick of Ottawa,\nHon. Edward B. Osier of Toronto, the\nI-ord Bishop of Montreal, Principal\nWilliam Peterson of McGill Universi\nty, Principal Maurice Hutton of Toron\nto University, and Hon. T. M. Daly\nof Winnipeg.\nOrganization.\nIt may be interesting to inquire how\nan Institute which covers so large a\nfield is governed, and how it secures\nfunds to carry on its work. The gov\nernment of the Institute is in the\nhands of a council composed of repre\nsentatives of the Affiliated Societies.\nThe council meets annually for the\nconduct of its business which is in\ntrusted to the executive committee in\nthe interim. The schools are govern\ned by managing committees, the offic\ners of which are ex-officio members\nof the council of the Institute.\nFunds are supplied partly by the an\nnual dues of members, partly by con\ntributions to the various schools from\nuniversities and colleges, and partly\nby gifts from private individuals. The\ncontributions of partons, ($1,000) and\nof life members ($100)' become part of\nthe endowment of the Institute which\nis in charge of an investing board con\nsisting of William Sloane, James\nSpeyer and Otto T. Bannard of New\nYork, W. K. Bixby of St. Louis, James\nB. Forgan of Chicago, and two Ca\nnadian members, Byron E. Walker of\nToronto, and Joseph B. Learmont of\nOttawa.\nActivity of the Local Society.\nThe Affiliated Society constitutes the\nnucleus of the membership of the In\nstitute, about which all its activities\ngather.\nThe success of the Affiliated Society\ndepends largely upon the city in\nwhich it is located, and upon the in\nfluence and activity of the president,\nsecretary and other members of the\nexecutive committee on whom the re\nsponsibility falls. The minimum num\nber of members admitting a society to\nthe Institute in full fellowship is fifty,\nthough a branch of twenty-five may\nbe organized, to be affiliated with\nsome other society until the requisite\nnumber is obtained.\nThe membership consists of teach\ners and professors interested in the\nhumanities; of architects, archaeolo\ngists and ethnologists, but most large\nly of cultivated men and women who\nhave an interest in this work as a\nmeans of promoting general culture,\nand who delight to hear lectures on\nartistic themes, and to give of their\nsubstance to good works.\nThe events in the regular life of a\nsociety are (1) the Annual Meeting\nwhen there is a social gathering of the\nentire membership, usually at the\nhouse of a member, for the election\nof officers and for the general consid\neration of the work of the Institute;\n(2) House meetings at the residences\nof prominent members, at which a\nlecture or address is given on some\narchaeological theme, and (3) public\nlectures given at the local university\nor in some large hall where outsiders\nmay be reached as well as the mem\nbers of the society. ,\nII. The Schools of Archaeology.\n1. The American School of Classi\ncal .Studies at Athens, founded in 1881,\nhas exerted a profound influence on\nhigher education through the scholars\nthat have enjoyed its privileges, and\nthe impetus it has given to scholar\nship. Its students hold positions of em\ninence in many of our leading univer\nsities and colleges. The members of\nthe school are graduates of colleges\nand universities, who recognize the\nincalculable advantage to be derived\nfrom firsthand knowledge of Greece\nand its monuments.

The American School of Classi\ncal Studies in Rome was established\nin 1895. It has opened up to college\nand high school instructors the vast\nresources of the Eternal City, and\nmuch of the quickened impulse in the\nstudy of the classics is due to the in\nfluence of the school on the teachers\nwho have spent a year or more in res\nidence. Its scientific work is of inter\nest to clergymen as well as to schol\nars, as the Fellowship in Christian\nArchaeology indicates. The Carnegie\nInstitution contributes fifteen hun\ndred dollars to this school, maintain-!\ning a Research Associate, and publish\nes the results of scientific investiga\ntions. The students have the benefit of lec\ntures by eminent Italians and Ger\nmans, and many privileges are grant\ned them at the Vatican and by the\nauthorities of other museums.\nEach of these schools has an endow\nment of one hundred thousand dollars\nand the additional support of contribu\ntions from leading universities and\ncolleges.\nIt is difficult to estimate -the value\nof a few years residence in Athens\nand Rome under the auspices of the\nschools of classical literature and art.\nStudents visit and explore under com\npetent guidance the most renowned\nsites of antiquity; they become ac\nquainted with the greatest master\npieces of art that survive; they ac\nquire from the monuments themselves\nthe principles of architecture and\nsculpture; they have the privilege of\nreading from the stones, inscriptions\nbearing on ancient history; and in\nthese sacred localities they receive an\ninspiration that enables them to im\npart to their pupils in turn, a living\nand abiding interest in the immortal\nworks of art and literature that lie\nat the source of modern civilization.\n3. The American School of Oriental\nStudy and Research in Palestine was\nfounded in 1900. It has already done\nimportant work of exploration in the\nHoly Land, and its usefulness is still ,\nin its infancy. The school has recently '\npurchased a site for a building and is\nnow raising funds for its erection. i\nBiblical antiquities appeal strongly !\nto every devout student of the Sacred\nSchiptures. We desire to know as\nmuch as possible of the places made\never memorable by the footprints of\nJesus of Nazereth. Palestine is a com-,\nparatively new field for archaeological\nexploration, and the abundant light\nthrown on the Old Testament by exca\nvations in Assyria and Babylonia\nleads us to hope that thorough excava\ntion of Palestine will add much to our\nknowledge of the Hebrew people.\n4. The School of American Archae- i\nology was founded in 1908. Its head\nquarters are in Santa Fe, New Mexico,\nwhere the historic Governor's Palace\nhas- been devoted by the territorial\nlegislature to the purposes of the\nschool, and the growth of a museum\nof American Archaeology. An exten\nsive system of co-operation with uni\nversities and scientific organizations\nfor investigation in the various parts\nof the American continent is being\ncarried out. Every summer, field cam\npaigns are conducted in Colorado,\nUtah and New Mexico under the aus\npices of the school. A permit for ex\ncavations in Old Mexico has been\ngranted by the Mexican government\nand an expedition to Central America\nhas been placed. The Affiliated So\ncieties in St. Louis, Colorado, Utah,\nLos Angeles and Seattle are taking\nactive part in these projects.\n5. Mediaeval and Renaissance\nStudies. A standing committee of the\nInstitute devotes itself to the promo\ntion of the study of the architecture,\npainting and scuplture of the medi\naeval and renaissance times. A fel\nlow is appointed in these studies who\nspends his time in study at the Ameri\ncan School in Rome, and lectures on\nRenaissance painters and sculptors\nare regularly given.\nIII. The System of Lectures.\nTo make known to its constituency\nthe results of archaeological research\nthe Institute sends out each year to\nall tlm societies three or four lectur\ners who are specialists in their respec\ntive fields or have just returned from\nsome important site. Owing to the\nvast extent, of country to be covered,\nfour lecture circuits are maintained,\nnamely, Eastern, Central, \"Western and\nCanadian. During 19O7-190S and in\nthe fall of 1909 Mr. D. G. Hogarth,\nCurator of the Ashmolean Museum,\nlectured on the Archaeology of Asia\nMinor, with special reference to his\nexcavation of the temple of Artemis at\nEphesus. In the spring of 1909-1910\nProf. John L. Myres lectured before\nthe Canadian Societies on the Archae\nology of Cyprus, and Prof. Christian\nHuelson, some time secretary of the\nGerman Archaeological Institute in\nRome, lectured in the United States\non Problems in Roman Archaeology.\nEfforts will be made to secure some\nforeign lecturer each year. It is en\ndeavored to have, annually, a lecturer\nin each field Greek, Roman, Oriental\nand American Archaeology.\nIV.

Ralph H, Baldwin, chaplain\nto the Bishop of New York, submitted\nthe llrst paper. Ho stated that the\nBible sketches history; archaeology\nwrites It in tho spirit of science. It bus\nshown that the Hebrew nation did not\ndwell upon a desert Isle, but lived In\ntouch with world. Archaeology Illumi?\nnates the page on which Is written the\nhistory of the world. For every Chris?\ntian it has a message, Its research hav?\ning thrown a Hood of light?a knowl?\nedge of the customs, places and events\nof sacred story. Certain critics have\nignored Its voice, but a study of arch?\naeology has been pursued successfully\nfor many years now by scholars of all\nschools. Its discoveries have revolu?\ntionised our Ideas of Oriental history,\nand prove that Moses could have writ?\nten the pentatcuch, thus destroying the\nassumption of the critics that he did\nnot write it. We own a debt to archaeo?\nlogy for tho identification of localities\nand tho history of many of the peoples\nof other times. From it we get much\ninformation of the past that is not In\nthe Bible. It was. however, by no will\niff man, but by the grace of Ood that\nthe records of tho past have been pre?\nserved, nnd the information they give\nis of enormous value In substantiating\nthe record of the Bilde, this information\nbeing of Incalculable value to the stu?\ndent and scholar. Save as we encour?\nage or retard the workers In archaeo?\nlogy do we hasten or delay the coming\nof the lime when the history of the past\nwill bo more fully known. Archaeology\nis building anew for us a knowledge of\nthe breadth and depth of the reality of\nthe time when the world was young.\nII iloes away with theorizing and\nleaches that all things come from Ood.\nAs we look through this wonderful glass\nof history and see the figures that play?\ned so large a part In the history of\nearly times, we cannot out return lo the\nBook of Books with renewed confidence\nund pleasure.\nThe Rev. Professor Angus, of the\nTheological Seminary of Virginia, read\nthe next paper. Ho said that the study\n.of archaeology had inspired Christians\nwith the hope that many quest Ions how\n? lark and misunderstood would finally\nbecome plain. It lias been assumed\nthat In the time of Moses the art of\nwriting was unknown, nnd there was\nnothing outside of the Bible to disprove\nthis assumption. There was no means\nof explaining many apparently unrea?\nsonable things that wore stated In the\nBible, and these facts were emphasized\nby the critics. Their assumptions have,\nhowever, been found baseless through\nthe spade of the explorer. Arebac ilogy\nproves that we hadn't the faintest con?\nception of the civilization of the post.\nThe relics In the museums would chal?\nlenge comparison with the most won?\nderful evidences of art to lie seen in\nTiffany's windows in New York. We\nnow know that lr.iiJ B. (*. was a wonder?\nful literary period. In the light of the\nrevelations of archaeology the critics\n:mw give up the assumption that the\npatriarchs couldn't write. The earlj\nnarratives of the Bible can now l>c at?\ntested and we no longer depend upon\n(he unsupported statements of the in?\nspired writers. The civilization of Ihoi ?\nages was vastly superior to anything\nwe had ever conceived of it.\nOriental archaeology, too, makes us\nrevise our commentaries. By it we can\ndate prophecies, and even the reigns of\ncertain kings. The very names of some\nof the Oriental chiefs have come tu llghi\nthrough it. Hitherto we have had noth?\ning with which to compare the Hebrew\nrace. Its moral concept ions, etc. Arch?\naeology has brought oUI an ethical i I -\nmen) In Israel which quickened her ra?\ntional conscience?of which her neigh?\nbors hardly dreamed; it shows that she\nwas designed to be a perm.neu: force\nIn the world, which force found its d -\nvelopment in Christ. it shows, too,\nmust fortunately, thai there was no'\nlong difference in time between the\nhappenings In the early book.- pf tie\nBib!\" and the making of the records\nthemselves, which fact gives to them so\nmuch more value, it has established\nbeyond question the literary condition\nof the patriarchal times; that the facts\nof the Bible were not floating around\nfor renturies and orally transmitted,\nbut that they were recorded from a-.\nt;> age as the events occurred. Critics\nhave assumed that the literary condi?\ntions of the early times did not permit\nof the writing of such books ns those\nof the Pentateuch, hut i: is certain thai\narchaeology lends nothing to tin- sup?\nport of th*> theory of a later authorship\nshows nothing thai would discredit the\nrecord of the Bible as to this. It has\nbeen held lhat Israeli In the time of\nMoses, was it small band of nomadic\nshepherds, hut we now have a marvel?\nous attestation of the Biblical record!\nThe critics have boon nil astray in their\nassumptions and the conclusions drawn\nfrom their wrong premises have been\nBWCpt away.\nHereafter wo must wait till the re?\ncords have spoken and not depend upon\nthe intellects of the nineteenth cen?\ntury critics.\nThe audience gave the reader an ova\n?.??iii of applause at the close of the\npaper.\nTHE ADDRESSES.\nThe hymn, \"Father of Mercies,\" was\nsung, and the speaker on tho topic. Prof.\nA. V. Williams Jackson, Ph. D.. profes?\nsor of languages In the Columbia Uni?\nversity, New York, quite a yqpng man\n?one of the youngest who has ad?\ndressed the Congress?was introduced,\nj He Is a very graceful nnd pleasant\nspeaker. He s:?d he felt like, Chaucer,\nI that he hadn't much to say, after what\nI had been so well said on the subject\n1 under discussion; that he would not\ni Speak ns a scholar, but as a humble\nj churchman who has seen the import?\nance of archaeology In Illustrating tho\n? sacred text. The scholar, ho said, has\ncome in and made the rocks to speak.\nand as we see tho ancient Inscriptions\nwe can appreciate the sacred record bet?\nter. By the revelations of arclyaeology\nwe can see how the spade has been used\nto turn up diamonds for the crown that\nIs to give so much light to the world.\nWo can think with pleasure of these\nsch6lars working In their quiet way to\nbring to us the light that will illumine\nnot only the old Bible, but the new, as\nwell as the words of Christ, whose name\nwe bear and under whoso bknner we\nwork.\nAt times the speaker was very elo?\nquent, and he Is gifted In word paint?\ning, which served him well as he fol?\nlowed the explorers after truth In their\nresearches In distant lands.\nThe last speaqcr was Rev. John P.\nPeters. D. DV, of New York, who is a\nnoted archaeologist, and was the leader\nof an exploring party in ancient lnnds.\nHe said that archaeology Is a part of\nthe modern crltlcul apparatus. It has\ntaken both archaeologists and higher\ncritics to Interpret certain passages. It\nwould not have been possible In some\ninstances for archaeology to have clear?\nly done It alone. Before anything hud\nbeen discovered archaeolog ically In Pal?\nestine, the speaker himself had attract?\ned attention to a passage In Jeremiah\nthat seemed to indicate that there\nwould be discoveries of this sort in that\npart of the world. Till full researches\nhave been made through archaeology\nJudgment should be withheld; The dif?\nficulty has been thai higher criticism of\none age has been adopted in the theo?\nlogy and then In later years had to bo\ngiven up. Explorations have already\ngone back 2,000 years before Archbishop\nUsher?by his llgu res?created the\nworld.\nThe difficulty with critics Is that they\ncould not lind In the oilier books of the\nBible that Moses wrote those attribut?\ned to him. The words. \"'First Cook of\n.Moses.\" us they appear in the Bible\nwere not in the original text. Those\nwords conic from higher critics of an?\nother time. What we must do Is to ex?\nplore back nearer the source of tho\ntradition as to the authorship. Many of\nthe dates in the Bible are not from the\noriginal text, but they are from the\nGreek School of Alexandria. Many\nIlling.? are in the Bible and believed to\nbe In the original text, but those things\nare the work of higher critics of other\nages. It might be thought that there\nis nothing in archaeology to determine\npositively the tiling's of which It treats,\nbut it is a science just as is higher\ncriticism. Put the spade into Palestine\nthen, and recover the treasures there\nhidden.\nTo Instance what archaelogy Is worth:\nI had learned from the best sources of\ninformal ion that the ancient city of\nGaxa was situated several miles from\nthe present town of Gaza, but when I\nwas at the hitter place place I noticed a\nhill that looked like a natural hill, but\nwhich, on close Investigation, proved to\nbo a heap of delbrts. At the base we\nfound the earth slipping away and\nthere discovered the wall of the ancient\n?iy, giving the lie to what was con?\nsidered up to that time as the besl au?\nthority on the subject. Great results\narc awaiting the touch of the spade in\nPalestine.\nThe hymn, \"O, Word of Qod Incar?\nnate.\" was sung and the Congress ad?\njourned till s p. in., with benediction\nby Bishop Randolph.\nThe Academy of Music was packed\nagain last evening to hear Ihe discus?\nsion of ihe tonic \"Progress In the Iri\niterpretatlon of Christian Symbols.\"\nBishop Randolph conducted the open?\ning exercises and introduced the first\nwriter, Itev. \\V. M. Hughes. D. !>.. of\nM?rrlstown, N. .).. who said In part:\n\"llow do we know that we have exact\nfacts; how <Vo we know that our religion\nis to be made a mockery by the men who\narc too orthodox to niter their views'.'\"\n\"If .leans be not the essence of Incar?\nnate being, then he fails io reveal to us\nsome mystic holy of holies, if this l>e\ntrue, to what religion shall we revert?\nShall we adopt the aneieiil Olympian\nfaith or thni of latter day pessimism?\n\"To avoid either of these we Chris?\ntian soldiers are lighting.

Ktlltor.H\nnnd Griuluutcs or Hnuiptoii<\nThe second day's exercises attendant\nupon the dedication of ithe Armstrong\nSlater Memorial Trade and Industrial\nSchcol at Hampton, was attended by\nmembers of the Episcopal Church Con?\ngress, in session In this city, 'who went\nover to tho number of 250 on the steamer\nHampton Ro>ad&i which had been char?\ntered especially for the occasion. The\nparty left Norfolk at 1 :30 o'clock, and\narriving at Hampton an hour later, they\nrepaired immediately -to the Memorial\nChurch, whore tho exercises were held.\nThe building was well filled when the\ndelegation of clergymen -arrived, and by\nthree o'clock It was packed und the au?\ndience overflowed tor.he stepstand lawns\nsurrounding the church.\nBishop Randolph opened the session,\nand on the platform were, besides the\nprominent Episcopal clergymen, many\ngraduates l\" the institution, men who\nby their own life-work have demonstrat?\ned the value of the course given al\nHampton, and who a:e living examples\nor the fact that through education or\nthe proper hind, teaching them ?;<> help\nthemselves and to teach others, both\nthe Indian und the negro race can be\nmade great people.\nA m .-: Inl resting feature Of the ox\nerclses was the plantation songs ren?\ndered by the student choir.\nTiie ilrst speaker was Dr. Frissell,\nprincipal of the institution, who spoke\nas follows.\nIn one of bis early reports, General\nArmstrong, speaking of the colored poo-'\npie of Uiis country, says: \"The race will\nsucceed or fall us it shall devote itself\nwith energy to agriculture und the me?\nchanic arts, or avoid these pursuits,' and\nits teachers must be inspired with tho\nspirit of hard work and acquainted with\nthe ways that lead to success.\" He goo.!\non to say that the pant of the colored\npopulation has been such that an insti?\ntution devoled especially to them must\nprovide n iraining more than usually\ncomprehensive, must Include both sexes\nand a variety of occupation, must pro?\nduce moral as well as mental Strength,\nand while makine its students first-class\nmechanical laborers, must also make\nthem llrst rate men and women.\nTRAINING OF TEACHERS.\nI This thought of Hampton's wise and\nfar-sighted founder has shaped and still\nshapes tin- policy of the school. In the\n[early days of the Institution, ami, in\nTai l, nil through its history, especial\nprominence has been given to the train?\ning of teachers for the public schools or\nthe South. In order to lit them to lie\nreal lenders of their race, much more\nwas needed than mere ins\".ruction in\nbooks. Habits of living nnd or regular\nindustry had to he formed. Two farms,\nsixteen shops, a large saw mill, the glfl\nof Mr. l\". I'. Huntington; have helped\ntowards this end. An Industrial village\nhits grown up, with Us dormitories,\nschool rooms, siov.-; nnd otlloos, where\nthe work of rial life is carried on.\nEvery student is no I merely a learner,\nhut a worker with regular duty's and\nthe responsibility of self help.\nPRACTICAL LESS) INS.\nThe iessdn <-f the school room is put\ninto practice in tin- shop or on the farm.\nThe problems or arithmetic, or natural\nphilosophy are connected with the no\nttiitl work of every day life, and so the\ngraduates id' Hampton have been fitted\nnot merely to teach in the si loud room,\nbut to build the house and bring up the\nworn out soil.\nThe young people have learned, not\nonly to do their work well, but to know\nwhat their work menus. They have\nlined a spirit of self-reliance end of\nmanliness: they have gone out as clll\nscens, able t<> teach by example and pre\ni right ideas of life and duty.\nCRISIS IN NEGROES HISTORY.\nIi has become clear that still further\nchanges are necessary in order that the\nwork which the school's founder planned\nbe onrrled out. with Hie growth ot in?\ndustrial schools in th - South, there\ncomes a demand upon Hampton ror\nmore mechanics than the sclio >l qan\nsupply through her apprenticeship sys?\ntem. Not only is there need for more\nindustrial teachers for the schools of\nthe South, but for more men scientifi?\ncally trained in the theory and princi?\nples <,r the trades than was possible in\nShops where production ami Instruction\nwere carrlqd pi) together. Moreover,\nt ie i ,' sei ms to those of us who ha re to\ndeal with this negro problem a crisis\nin the history of the race. In certain\npart's of the South the colored people are\nnot holding their own In the trades\nwhich were taught in slavery days. As\nthe trades unions <.f tie- North push into\nthe South the negroes tiro being driven\nfrom the carpenter's bench arid the\nblacksmith's shop, ami thus forced into\nth - more menial occupations. Unless\nHampton, Tuskegoo, ami other indus?\ntrial schools of the South, can supply\nno n capable of sinning shops tor their\nown race, and of eiopioyin;; and training\ncolored mechanics, there will bo little\nchance for the negro for holding the\nhost heritage loft him by slavery.\nMAKE GOOD FARMERS.\nNot only is it necessary that Hampton\ndo hotter work In the trades; It Is quite\nas l.TTportanl that it push the matter of\nmproved Instruction in agriculture und\ndomestic science. The building to be\nopened to-day is one of three, the plans\nof which have already been submitted\nto the trusti es of tie- Hampton Institute\nand the educational committee of the\n?lohn F. Slater Fund Board, and ap?\nproved by them.\nSALVATION tiF TWO BACKS.\nThe salvation <>f He- negro and the\nIndian lies very largely In gaining and\nproperly cultivating the soil. They havi\nnow an opportunity to obtain land at\ncheap rates. This opportunity will not\nong continue. Already there Is a move?\nment on tho part or settlers of th\"\nNorthwest towards the rich, unoccupied\nlands oi\" the Southern states, while tin\nreservat Ion land of the Indian is eagerly\nnought by Western farmers. Hampton\nmust stitl out enlhusldtlc agricultural?\nists, in order to accomplish this, lie\nstudents who go out from here must\nnot only have been put through the reg\nular routine of farm work, but must\nhave thorough, systematic Instruction\n(Continued on the Klghth Page.)\nIS A GOOD TIME TO SELECT A NEW SUIT FOR\nTHAT BOY OF YOURS.\nTHE HUB\"\nhas just received from Bal?\ntimore headquarters scores\nof new and pretty effects in Juvenile Suits in a superb\nvariety of winsome weavings.

Although the president was em\npowered to move the museum , from\nMay 20 , 1831 , to the building former\nly occupied by the now extinct Inquisi\ntion , the date of removal was indefi\nnitely postponed and the establish\nment continued its existence at the\nuniversity without being able to make\nthe slightest development. For many\nyears afterward It was grossly neg\nlected.\n* CHALWUHTLC2jTH AZTEC Maximilian\" a decree was Issued , De-\nOf' WATER. V\" * * comber 1 , 1SC3 , declaring that the Pub-\nlie Museum or\nNatural Ills-\ntory.

In fact , Mexico may today very\nproperly claim the title of \"Tho Egypt of Amer\nica \" Why , indeed , should the archaeologist go to\n'Egypt ' , when Mexico offers to him such rich and\ninexhaustible fields as Mltla , Monte Alban , Palen-\nquo , San Juau de Teotihuacan. the ruins of Ux-\nmal , and of Chi Chen Itza in Yucatan , and many\nothers which are Just being unearthed ?\nThe museum located at tha national capital is\ngenerally the first place sought out by the thou\nsands of tourists who pour into the country each\nyear. And it is well worth a visit , for it offers cer\ntain things which no other museum in the world\ncould offer to the eyes of the curious.\nThe best brief sketch of its history is given by\nits director , Lie. Genaro Garcia , himself a notable\nhistorian and archaeologist , in the introduction\nof volume 1 , No. 1 , of the \"Annals of the National\nMuseum of Archaeology , History and Ethnology , \"\na most creditable publication which is Issued\nmonthly by the institution , under the direct super\nvision of Lie. Garcia. In speaking of the founda\ntion of the museum which ho has brought up to\nsuch a creditable standard , Lie. Garcia says :\nUnder the Spanish domination there existed\nonly n small collection of antiquities in Mexico ,\nconsisting , for the greater part , of the codexes\nand native manuscripts which a cavalier of Milan ,\nItaly , Don Lorenzo de Uoturinl y Benaducl , Senor\ndo la Tore y Homo , had been able to collect , at\nthe cost of unheard-of sacrifices , and which were\n*\n\" onfiacated in the most unjust manner by the\nvice-regal government in 1743. These antiquities\nwere first kept In the office of the viceroy's secre\ntary , and afterward In the library of the Royal\nand Pontifical University of Mexico , where they\nwere taken by order of His Excellency Antonio\nMaria de Bucarell y Ursua , viceroy of New Spain.\nIn one and another place they were greatly dam-\nuged by neglect , humidity , rats and thefts.\nUpon the consummation of Mexico's Indepen\ndence the national government not only directed\nthat the existing antiquities bo kept at the same\nuniversity , but assigned , in addition , the sum of\n$1,892 , 1 real and 1 \"grano , \" for the salaries of a\ndirecting professor of botany , a gardener , and the\nexpenses of the garden.\nWhen this appropriation was made the gov\nernment did not as yet have In rnind the establish\nment of n national museum which , according to\nGen. Lucas Alamnn , then secretary of state and\nforeign relations , in a memorial presented to con\ngress on January 11 , 1S25 , was to ho a matter for\nthe future. Notwithstanding all this , Don Sebas\ntian Camacho , successor to General Alnman , an\nnounced to congress during the latter part of the\nsame year that the National museum had boon\nestablished , \"under the most happy auspices , with\na keeper Intrusted with its arrangement , safety ,\nand development , \" and with many projects for\n\"scientific trips , discoveries , excavations , and\nother operations\" which were never made. The\nmuseum , therefore , had no other end than that\nof the conservation of a few antiquities , unclas\nsified , and In generally bad shape.\nThe museum proper had its birth by virtue of\nIQ decree of November 21 , which ordered Its for-\nrmal creation and its division into three branches\nantiquities , products of natural history and In\ndustry , and botanical garden.\nThe chief executive of the republic proceeded\nat once to the organization of the museum in ac\ncordance with the foregoing decree , and appointed\nas members of the directive board Messrs. Pablo\ndo la Llavo , Isldro Ignaclo Icoza , Miguel Busta-\nman to , Jose Mariano Sanchez Mora , Ignaclo Cu-\nlt occupies to\nday , the same\nhaving been\nused before as the Casa do Moneda ; that It should\nhave a library , to be formed from books owned by\nthe university and by the convents which had Just\nbeen abolished , and that the government would\nprovide the expenses of Installation , conserva\ntion , and development.\nAfter the constitutional government triumphed\nover Maximilian , It appropriated , In the budget for\n1867-1S68 , the sum of $12,000 for the museum ; half\nof which was for expenses and tSia other half for\nthe salaries of a director , two professors of natu\nral history , a preparador , a clerk , an errand boy ,\nand a porter. Unfortunately th poverty of the\npublic treasury at that time prevented thp govern\nment for many years from increoslng tlia appro\npriations for the museum , which only reached $12.-\n100 during the fiscal year 1876-1877 , for which rea\nson it had little-opportunity to make any progress.\nWhen Gen. Porflrio Diaz came into the supreme\nmagistracy of the republic , he , the Indisputable re\nstorer of the public peace and the first factor in\nthe actual progress of Mexico , gave a great Im\npulse to all the federal educational establishments.\nThe museum , which In 1877-1878 only had an ap\npropriation of $13,360 , received an Increase each\nyear , until in the year 1901 it reached the sum\nof $24,797.20. In this manner Its development was\nenabled to keep pace with the rest of the country\nThe progress of the museum has been very\nrapid slnco Lie. Don Justo Sierra , secretary of\npublic instruction , took charge of the educational\ndevelopment of Mexico , and during the past three\nyears it has enlarged Its collections until they con\nsist of nearly 70,000 objects. Such nn abnormal de\nvelopment mndo the space occupied by it too\nsmall , and It was divided into two departments :\nNational Museum of History , Archaeology , and\nEthnology , and National Museum of History. The\nformer remains in the National palace , and the\nlatter is being removed to a new building of suf\nficient slzo for Its requirements.\nA sti iking proof of the efforts made by the\nsupreme government to perfect its educational es\ntablishments is the fact that the present annual\nappropriation for the museum of $120,000 is almost\nten times ns great as was the appropriation of\n1SC7-18G8.\nThe publication in which this sketch appeared\nis of comparatively recent origin , In so far as its\nactual importance is concerned. It was founded\nin 1S77 , its director at that time being Prof. Gu-\nmcslndo Mendoza , his principal collaborators beIng -\nIng Manuel Orozco y Derra , and Lie. Alfredo Cha-\nvero. It was not at that time printed in the mu\nseum , as it is only slnco 1885 that the printing\nplant of the museum , which had a very humble be\nginning , got its start , the nucleus of which was a\nsmall Colomblno press , model 2 , chiefly used for\nrunning oft cards , or classification slips for the\nobjects contained In the establishment. From this\ntime on , however , the various directors who came\nand went , each recognizing the importance of hav\ning n well equipped print shop , made important\nadditions , until the plant attained its highest do-\ngro of efficiency , a year or so ago , with the acquisi\ntion of an Optlmus press. To celebrate its acqui\nsition two special studies were written and run off\non the new press , ono of which , entitled \"Porfhio\nDiaz , Sus Padres , NInez y Juvontud\" ( \"Porflrio\nDiaz , his parents , childhood and youth\" ) , was writ\nten by Lie. Garcia , then profeseor of history in\nthe museum , and the edition , which was beautiful\nly gotten up , was immediately exhausted.\nShortly after this , or about the middle of 1907.\nCMLIZATJO'tf\nLie. Garcia was mndo subdlrcctor of the\nmuseum , Ktlll letalnlng , however , the\nchair of history. Ho was oven nt this\ntlmo ono of the most widely known In\ntellectual figures in the republic , hav\ning been n member of the chamber of\ndeputies since 1S94 , but better\nknown throughout Mexico as a his\ntorian. Some of the books which\nhave emanated fiom his pen are :\n\"Character of the Spanish Conquest\nin America and Mexico , \" \"Tho Plan\nof Independence of New Spain In\n1808 , \" \"Denial Diaz del Castillo's\nConquest of Mexico , According to\nthe Autograph Codex , \" ' Juarez a\nRefutation of Don Francisco Rul-\nHUB , aim j uuiiii viuunu , uiu in-\nff - . surgent Heroine. \" Resides these he\nhas prepared 28 volumes of unpub\nlished documents relative to the\nhistory of Mexico. Upon his promotion to the posi\ntion Lie. Garcia immediately proceeded to the sci\nentific classification of the many articles contained\nIn the museum , giving to each object a card specify\ning both its vulgar and scientific name , the place\nwhcro it originated , and such other observations as\nwould give the public an Intelligent Idea regarding\nit. He added greatly to the collections of the mu\nseum , acquiring in ono year alone 74,000 objects ,\nand perfected the official publication known as\n\"Anales del Museo Naclonnl , \" bringing it up to such\na high standard that it is today perhaps the best\npublication of its kind In the world.\nHaving finally been made director In chief , Lie.\nGarcia secured the separation of the museum Into\ntwo departments , thus making n separate branch\nentirely of the department of natural history and\nsubdividing the national museum of archaeology ,\nhistory , and ethnology Into six departments arch-\nneology , history , ethnology , industrial retrospective\nart , publications , and library.\nThe department of archaeology Is composed of\nseven largo halls , which are called \"salon azteca , \"\n\"salon toltecn \" \"salon tarasco \" \" \"\n, , \"salon mlxtecn ,\n\"salon zapotoca , \" etc. , each hall thus representing\na distinct division of Mexican archaeology.\nThe department of history consists of four \"sn-\nlones , \" situated in the principal Inner section of the\nthird floor , in which are exhibited many Inteiestlng\nobjects.\nThe department of ethnology occupies almost\nthe entire second floor and contains mostly ob\njects strictly related to the aborigines such as\nplaster casts of heads , hands , and feet ; dress , fur\nniture , chattels , etc ; photographs and oil paintings ;\nIndustrial products , and ethnological maps , all clas\nsified In a similar manner to those In the depart\nment of archaeology.\nThe department of industrial retrospective an\nconsists of five \"saloncs , \" and was created only re\ncently by Lie. Garcia. In the first salon are ex\nhibited a seiles of oil paintings representing the\ncostumes worn by the citizens of different epochs In\nthe nation's history , from the tlmo of Cortez down.\nIn the second salon nro six largo glabs cases In\nwhich are exhibited objects of iron , Jewels , cos\ntumes , military objects , etc. In the third salon are\nthrro largo glass cases In which nro to bo found\ndining-room articles , all grouped according to\nclasses , among which will bo found part of the mag\nnificent table service of the Emperor Maximilian.\nIn the fourth salon Maxlllmlan's royal carriage la\nexhibited , as is his road carriage. Close by is the\ncoach which belonged to Juarez , the restorer of the\nrepublic , in which ho traveled when pursued by the\nImperialist armies. The fifth salon contains many\nobjects of high artistic value.\nThe department of publications Is ono of tha\nmost important In the museum , and has charge oi\nnil the documents which\nare printed iclatlvo to it\nIt is nt present preparing , in commemoration oi\nMexico's centennial , which will begin In September ,\na number of volumes which will treat of the differ\nent plans which were formulated for the country\nemancipation from Spain.\nThe library is situated on the lower floor , a few\nstops from the main entrance , and the books which\nIt contains are classified In\nperfect order , &o that\nit is an easy matter for the person wishing to look\nup any certain point In history , archaeology , or oth\nuology to get full and complete data at very\nnotice.\nBLOODY MASSACRE BY INDIANS\nIN YUCATAN.\nARE HOLDING VALLADOLID\nReports of Cnuso of Outbreak Are\nConflicting Former Head of the\nCivil Government Is Said to\nBe in Command.\nMexico City With telegraph wires\ncut and upuintots murdered or forced\nto flco , definite Information Is lacking\nas to the proHunt situation at Valla-\ndulld , Yucatan , the scene of a bloody\nmassacre by Indian Insurgents neve nil\ndnjs ago.
