# what I was trying to do

build a static website

+ tutorial: https://graddh.netlify.app/docs/tutorials/photogrammetry/
+ repo: `[website](https://github.com/bad-d0nkey/bad-d0nkey.github.io)`

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

it's a place to showcase things i create for/with the public. and it's probably just a good idea to know how to do this in general. i'm very much over using wordpress and wix and squarespace and.... yup.

## what I did

+ step 1: basics
  + read the tutorial. 
  + ran through the basics and set up a repo. 
  + looked at the results. 
  + established a baseline.

+ step 2: investigating the things
  + spent some time creeping on the static websites of others for whom i could find both a front-end and the repo proper to identify what parts do what
  + found the guide file for the templates -> this was helpfulish

+ step 3: tried to identify how to edit the side menu
  + this didn't really work out. i read all the things. i intertubesed. i couldn't figure it. save question for discord. 
    + i do tech things at night _and_ am two hours behind Ottawa - posting questions during that time isn't helpful, particularly when i may have solved it by the time people wake up. hence the "saving" for discord.  

+ step 4: tried to identify how to make a site navigable
  + this didn't really work out, either. i read all the things. i intertubesed. i couldn't figure it. save question for discord.   
  + i have separate pages, but not links between them. 
  + edit index? or something? index seems like a word chosen on purpose. i mean, it could have been called "giraffe". it wasn't. this must be a clue!

+ step 5: uploaded things 
  + i'll figure out how to link things later. i can still get the content up now. 

+ step 6: ze questions
  + asperger's happened. i'm just going to leave this. i know i'm overwhelmed by peopleing and the way i have to do it - small bites, not really synchronously - isn't ideal for working through things. hiccups happen. so let it be for now! fresh eyes and fresh brain invariably help and generally let me come up with a different way to ask my questions - hopefully while also frustrating other people less. lol. 
  + for now, i've got stuff up and accessible. it's okay that it's ugly. when i have a bit more ground under me, i'll know how to ask the things i need to ask in a way that doesn't rub people wrong or sound like i've not done any groundwork. that's a good place to be. it's progress and it's all i can ask for.

## challenges 

this is probably wildly inappropriate for a log, but it's actually my main takeaway, so i'm writing about it. 

i've been trying to find a way to handle the excessive communication that arose with the plague. tech used to be my refuge. now it's a place that sort of replicates the real world and the "rules" for my sneaky world have changed. i don't know how to rebuild different approaches to a structure i've operated well within for over a decade. workin' on it, though. 

having a group that kicks ass to figure this stuff out with is great. yeah, i've rubbed some the wrong way. i'm okay with that. all i can do is be consistent and keep improving how i interact with folks. everyone is still supportive and helpful. this is a good space to grow. i didn't expect this at all and i'm pretty grateful for it. 

so my static website is gross. that's cool. i learned a bunch of other things that are a lot more important in trying to work out the issues with this project. which is also cool. 

## thoughts on where to go next

well, a workable website would be great. but right now i'm thinking about non-tech things. i'm happy with that.
