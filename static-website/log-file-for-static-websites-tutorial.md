# what I was trying to do

build a static website

+ tutorial: https://graddh.netlify.app/docs/tutorials/photogrammetry/
+ repo: `[website](https://github.com/bad-d0nkey/bad-d0nkey.github.io)`

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

it's a place to showcase things i create for/with the public. and it's probably just a good idea to know how to do this in general. i'm very much over using wordpress and wix and squarespace and.... yup.

## what I did

+ step 1: basics
  + read the tutorial. 
  + ran through the basics and set up a repo. 
  + looked at the results. 
  + established a baseline.

+ step 2: investigating the things
  + spent some time creeping on the static websites of others for whom i could find both a front-end and the repo proper to identify what parts do what
  + found the guide file for the templates -> this was helpfulish

+ step 3: tried to identify how to edit the side menu
  + this didn't really work out. i read all the things. i intertubesed. i couldn't figure it. save question for discord. 
    + i do tech things at night _and_ am two hours behind Ottawa - posting questions during that time isn't helpful, particularly when i may have solved it by the time people wake up. hence the "saving" for discord.  

+ step 4: tried to identify how to make a site navigable
  + this didn't really work out, either. i read all the things. i intertubesed. i couldn't figure it. save question for discord.   
  + i have separate pages, but not links between them. 
  + edit index? or something? index seems like a word chosen on purpose. i mean, it could have been called "giraffe". it wasn't. this must be a clue!

+ step 5: uploaded things 
  + i'll figure out how to link things later. i can still get the content up now. 

+ step 6: ze questions
  + vocabulary got in the way. asperger's happened. i'm just going to leave this. fresh eyes and fresh brain invariably help and generally let me come up with a different way to ask my questions.
  + for now, i've got stuff up and accessible. it's okay that it's ugly. when i have a bit more ground under me, i'll know how to ask the things differently. good enough for me. progress is progress - can't ask for more.

## challenges 

not sure how to articulate this. right now i'm in a donk loop, i think. it comes down to figuring out how to ask about things i don't know the words for. but i need more time to think about this. something will shake loose. always does.

## thoughts on where to go next

well, a workable website and being comfortable with setting these up would be pretty cool. definitely something i'll be spending more time with.
